* "phone-background" not working was fixed. This resulted from using ".header" intead of "#header" when addressing the header element.

* The function "closemenu()" was replaced with "togglemenu()".

* "fas"  times and bar icons were replaced with div with the class name "burger" and span elements with the class name "bar".

* The burger element was automated to transform to a "K" on click and revert to its base state when clicked a second time.

* Also, a div element with the classname "blocker" was added.

* The blocker element, the burger and the "navlink" elements were designed to control the "menu" element.

* In the second script element, the "querySelector()" was used instead of the "getElementById()" method.
